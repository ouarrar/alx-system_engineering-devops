**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: March 10, 2024, 14:30 UTC
  - End Time: March 11, 2024, 03:45 UTC
- **Impact:**
  - The outage affected the core authentication service, resulting in a complete disruption of user logins.
  - Approximately 35% of users experienced login failures, leading to a significant degradation in user experience.

**Timeline:**

- **Detection Time:**
  - March 10, 2024, 14:45 UTC
- **Detection Method:**
  - Automated monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden spike in error rates during user authentication.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated the authentication service logs to identify potential issues.
  - Assumed an external DDoS attack due to the sudden nature of the error surge.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Focused on network-related issues initially, leading to unnecessary downtime.
  - Explored potential database connection problems without concrete evidence.
- **Escalation:**
  - Incident escalated to the DevOps and Security teams after initial investigations.
- **Resolution:**
  - Identified a misconfiguration in the authentication service, causing it to reject valid user credentials.
  - Applied a rollback to the previous service configuration, restoring normal operation.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:**
  - A recent deployment introduced an undocumented change in the authentication service configuration, leading to an unexpected rejection of valid user credentials.
- **Resolution:**
  - Rolled back the authentication service to the previous known-good configuration.
  - Implemented a post-deployment checklist to catch undocumented changes during future releases.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Strengthen the deployment process by incorporating automated configuration validation checks.
  - Enhance monitoring to proactively detect configuration anomalies and unauthorized changes.
  - Conduct a thorough review of the deployment pipeline to identify and document potential pitfalls.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement version control for configuration files to track changes and easily roll back.
  - Introduce automated testing for critical components during the deployment process.
  - Enhance communication channels between development and operations teams to facilitate quicker issue resolution.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of the incident response plan and update it based on lessons learned.
  - Schedule a knowledge-sharing session to disseminate insights gained from the incident across relevant teams.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the web stack outage was a result of an undocumented configuration change during a recent deployment. The incident highlighted the importance of rigorous deployment procedures, comprehensive monitoring, and efficient communication between teams. By implementing the suggested corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our systems against similar issues in the future, ensuring a more resilient and reliable user experience.
